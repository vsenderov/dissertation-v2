	abstract = {We utilize an Answer Set Programming (ASP) approach to show that the principles of nomenclature are tractable in computational logic. To this end we design a hypothetical, 20 nomenclatural taxon use case with starting conditions that embody several overarching principles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; including Binomial Nomenclature, Priority, Coordination, Homonymy, Typification, and the structural requirement of Gender Agreement. The use case ending conditions are triggered by the reinterpretation of the diagnostic features of one of 12 type specimens anchoring the corresponding species-level names. Permutations of this child-to-parent reassignment action lead to 36 alternative scenarios, where each scenario requires 1-14 logically contingent nomenclatural emendations. We show that an ASP transition system approach can correctly infer the Code-mandated changes for each scenario, and visually output the ending conditions. The results provide a foundation for further developing logic-based nomenclatural change optimization and compliance verification services, which could be applied in globally coordinated nomenclatural registries. More generally, logic explorations of nomenclatural and taxonomic change scenarios provide a novel means of assessing design biases inherent in the principles of nomenclature, and thus may inform the design of future, big data-compatible identifier systems for systematic products that recognize and mitigate these constraints.},

	abstract = {Darwin-SW (DSW) is an RDF vocabulary designed to complement the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Darwin Core Standard. DSW is based on a model derived from a community discussion about the relationships among the main Darwin Core classes. DSW creates a new class to accommodate an important aspect of its model that is not currently part of Darwin Core: a class of Tokens, which are forms of evidence. DSW uses Web Ontology Language (OWL) to make assertions about the classes in its model and to define object properties that are used to link instances of those classes. A goal in the creation of DSW was to facilitate consistent markup of biodiversity data so that RDF graphs created by different providers could be easily merged. Accordingly, DSW provides a mechanism for testing whether its terms are being used in a manner consistent with its model. Two transitive object properties enable the creation of simple SPARQL queries that can be used to discover new information about linked resources whose metadata are generated by different providers. The Organism class enables semantic linking of biodiversity resources to vocabularies outside of TDWG that deal with observations and ecological phenomena.},

	doi = {10.1101/058834},
	abstract = {We utilize an Answer Set Programming (ASP) approach to show that the principles of nomenclature are tractable in computational logic. To this end we design a hypothetical, 20 nomenclatural taxon use case with starting conditions that embody several overarching principles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; including Binomial Nomenclature, Priority, Coordination, Homonymy, Typification, and the structural requirement of Gender Agreement. The use case ending conditions are triggered by the reinterpretation of the diagnostic features of one of 12 type specimens anchoring the corresponding species-level names. Permutations of this child-to-parent reassignment action lead to 36 alternative scenarios, where each scenario requires 1-14 logically contingent nomenclatural emendations. We show that an ASP transition system approach can correctly infer the Code-mandated changes for each scenario, and visually output the ending conditions. The results provide a foundation for further developing logic-based nomenclatural change optimization and compliance verification services, which could be applied in globally coordinated nomenclatural registries. More generally, logic explorations of nomenclatural and taxonomic change scenarios provide a novel means of assessing design biases inherent in the principles of nomenclature, and thus may inform the design of future, big data-compatible identifier systems for systematic products that recognize and mitigate these constraints.},

	abstract = {Biologists use scientific names to label the organisms described in their data; however, these names are not unique identifiers for taxonomic entities. Alternative taxonomic classifications may apply the same name, associated with alternative definition or circumscription. Consequently, labelling data with scientific names alone does not unambiguously distinguish between taxon concepts. Accurate integration and comparison of biological data is required on taxon concepts, as defined in alternative taxonomic classifications. We have derived an abstract, inclusive model for the diverse representations of taxonomic concepts used by taxonomists and in taxonomic databases. This model has been implemented as a proposed standard XML schema for the exchange and comparison of taxonomic concepts between data providers and users. The representation and exchange of taxon definitions conformant with this schema will facilitate the development of taxonomic name/concept resolution services, allowing the meaningful integration and comparison of biological datasets, with greater accuracy than on the basis of name alone.},

This approach should not limit the authors to use a set of standard terms, on the contrary, authors should be free to use the terms of their choice and record their terms and term usages in an open access ontology for their taxon group.

We review what data are, according to current influential definitions, and previous work on the benefits, costs and norms of data sharing in the sciences broadly. To understand data sharing in archaeology, we present the results of three pilot studies: requests for data by email; review of data availability in published articles, and analysis of archaeological datasets deposited in repositories. We find that archaeologists are often willing to share, but discipline-wide sharing is patchy and ad hoc. Legislation and mandates are effective at increasing data-sharing, but editorial policies at journals lack adequate enforcement. Although most of data available at repositories are licensed to enable flexible reuse, only a small proportion of the data are stored in structured formats for easy reuse. We present some suggestions for improving the state of date sharing in archaeology, among these is a standard for citing data sets to ensure that researchers making their data publicly available receive appropriate credit.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two added constructs: (1) the ability to draw values at random from distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program via observations. Models from diverse application areas such as computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, biology and reliability analysis can be written as probabilistic programs. Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly speciﬁed by a probabilistic program. Depending on the application, the desired output from inference may vary—we may want to estimate the expected value of some function f with respect to the distribution, or the mode of the distribution, or simply a set of samples drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we describe connections this research area called “Probabilistic Programming” has with programming languages and software engineering, and this includes language design, and the static and dynamic analysis of programs. We survey current state of the art and speculate on promising directions for future research.},

LLVM deﬁnes a common, low-level code representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and eﬃciently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and eﬀectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the beneﬁts LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

	abstract = {Understanding the history of events that have shaped the tree of life is a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology. We recognize the inherent benefits—and agree with the general approach—of pursuing this goal using explicitly model-based methods implemented in a Bayesian statistical framework. Accordingly, we appreciate both the motivation for and the general approach adopted by the BAMM method. Based on the enthusiastic response from the biological community, it seems clear that we are not alone in this regard. Unfortunately, as conceived and implemented, BAMM is a flawed method. First, the likelihood function is incorrect: It ignores diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages, which biases estimates of the extinction probabilities—and therefore, the overall likelihood of the data—when speciation and extinction rates may vary. In principle, this issue can be solved: We developed a computationally intensive numerical solution that (although impractical) can correctly estimate extinction probabilities and likelihoods. Second, the CPP prior model used to describe the distribution of diversification-rate shifts over the tree further confounds the method: The weak identifiability of the CPP model causes the inferred number of diversification-rate shifts to be extremely sensitive to arbitrary prior assumptions. Moreover, the CPP prior model does not provide a statistically coherent description of the relevant branching process; solutions to the problems with the prior model are far more intractable. We have shown that these theoretical issues cause inferences using BAMM to be unreliable. We are hopeful that a reliable, model-based, Bayesian approach for detecting diversification-rate shifts can eventually be developed, but this remains a difficult and unsolved problem.},

	abstract = {Approximate probabilistic inference algorithms are central to many fields. Examples include sequential Monte Carlo inference in robotics, variational inference in machine learning, and Markov chain Monte Carlo inference in statistics. A key problem faced by practitioners is measuring the accuracy of an approximate inference algorithm on a specific data set. This paper introduces the auxiliary inference divergence estimator (AIDE), an algorithm for measuring the accuracy of approximate inference algorithms. AIDE is based on the observation that inference algorithms can be treated as probabilistic models and the random variables used within the inference algorithm can be viewed as auxiliary variables. This view leads to a new estimator for the symmetric KL divergence between the approximating distributions of two inference algorithms. The paper illustrates application of AIDE to algorithms for inference in regression, hidden Markov, and Dirichlet process mixture models. The experiments show that AIDE captures the qualitative behavior of a broad class of inference algorithms and can detect failure modes of inference algorithms that are missed by standard heuristics.},

Over a mean period of 12 months a good or satisfactory blood pressure response resulted in 12 patients each, while six others had an unsatisfactory outcome. (Good = diastolic pressure (DP) less than 95 mmHg; Satisfactory = deltaDP greater than 15 mmHg or DP 95-105 mmHg; Unsatisfactory = DP greater than 105 mmHg or deltaDP less than 15mmHg.)

	abstract = {The constant rate birth–death process is used as a stochastic model for many biological systems, for example phylogenies or disease transmission. As the biological data are usually not fully available, it is crucial to understand the effect of incomplete sampling. In this paper, we analyze the constant rate birth–death process with incomplete sampling. We derive the density of the bifurcation events for trees on n leaves which evolved under this birth–death-sampling process. This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efﬁciently simulating trees. We show that the birth–death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth–death process with reduced rates and complete sampling. This shows that joint inference of birth rate, death rate and sampling probability is not possible. The birth–death-sampling process is compared to the sampling-based population genetics model, the coalescent. It is shown that despite many similarities between these two models, the distribution of bifurcation times remains different even in the case of very large population sizes. We illustrate these ﬁndings on an Hepatitis C virus dataset from Egypt. We show that the transmission times estimates are signiﬁcantly different—the widely used Gamma statistic even changes its sign from negative to positive when switching from the coalescent to the birth–death process.},

ral networks to amortize the cost of inference
in models from the family induced by uni-
versal probabilistic programming languages,
establishing a framework that combines the
strengths of probabilistic programming and
deep learning methods. We call what we do
“compilation of inference” because our method
transforms a denotational specification of an
inference problem in the form of a probabilis-
tic program written in a universal program-
ming language into a trained neural network
denoted in a neural network specification lan-
guage. When at test time this neural network
is fed observational data and executed, it per-
forms approximate inference in the original
model specified by the probabilistic program.
Our training objective and learning procedure
are designed to allow the trained neural net-
work to be used as a proposal distribution in
a sequential importance sampling inference
engine. We illustrate our method on mixture
models and Captcha solving and show signifi-
cant speedups in the efficiency of inference.},

From resting cell experiments evidence was found for a pathway of ethane oxidation via ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid. In vitro studies indicated that ethane-oxidizing activity in such mycelia occurred predominantly in the microsomal fraction of crude homogenates. Microsomal preparations were inactive in the absence of added coenzyme. Marked stimulation of activity was obtained in such preparations with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and to a much lesser degree with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Ethane oxidation was inhibited by sodium azide and carbon monoxide.},

This backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names from one source to another.

	doi = {10.5281/zenodo.56660},
	abstract = {The current document describes the data publishing policies of Pensoft Publishers, with an emphasis on biodiversity and biodiversity-related ecological data. Publishing the data associated with research articles is strongly encouraged in all Pensoft’s journals.

Data publishing in this digital age is the act of making data available on the Internet, so that they can be downloaded, analysed, re-used and cited by people and organisations other than the creators of the data. This can be achieved in various ways. In the broadest sense, any upload of a dataset onto a freely accessible website could be regarded as “data publishing”. There are, however, several issues to be considered during the process of data publication, including:

Data hosting, long-term preservation and archiving

Documentation and metadata

Citation and credit to the data authors

Licenses for publishing and re-use

Data interoperability standards

Format of published data

Software used for creation and retrieval

Dissemination of published data

This Data Publishing Policies document describes some general concepts, including a definition for datasets, incentives to publish data, and methods and licenses for data publishing. Further, it defines and compares the two main routes for data publishing, namely as supplementary information files to research articles, which may be made 3 available directly by the publisher, or published in a specialized data repository with a link to the research article or a Data Paper,  i.e. a specific, stand-alone publication describing a particular dataset or a collection of datasets.

More detailed instructions on how to prepare data for publication are listed below under the Guidelines for Authors. The Guidelines for Reviewers section describes the main criteria for evaluation of data during the peer-review and editorial process. Special attention is given to existing standards, protocols and tools to facilitate data publishing, such as the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) and the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A).

A separate section describes some of the leading data hosting/indexing infrastructures and repositories for biodiversity and ecological data.},

In this paper, we report on the ongoing transfer eﬀorts and data mapping challenges, and provide an analysis of the eﬀort so far.

This paper describes BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform that aims to enable users to query the probable implications of their data as directly as SQL databases enable them to query the data itself. This paper focuses on four aspects of BayesDB: (i) BQL, an SQL-like query language for Bayesian data analysis, that answers queries by averaging over an implicit space of probabilistic models; (ii) techniques for implementing BQL using a broad class of multivariate probabilistic models; (iii) a semi-parametric Bayesian model-builder that auomatically builds ensembles of factorial mixture models to serve as baselines; and (iv) MML, a “meta-modeling” language for imposing qualitative constraints on the model-builder and combining baseline models with custom algorithmic and statistical models that can be implemented in external software. BayesDB is illustrated using three applications: cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites; assessing the evidence for temporal dependence between macroeconomic indicators; and analyzing a salary survey.},
